Later that evening when they were having dinner together at home their daughter said something about how sad she felt because no one had ever been kind enough to ask them if everything was alright during all these years since moving into this little house near everyone else's homes yet still feeling like outsiders among friends as well as strangers alike. This made both parents realize just how much love could be lost through silence or indifference towards others around us even though we may think our actions are insignificant compared to those bigger than ourselves such as wars between nations etcetera... So from then on whenever anyone new would come along visiting either family member they always took some extra care not only showing hospitality but also taking interest in each other's lives more deeply than before - thus proving once again that kindness can indeed change hearts & minds forever!",
