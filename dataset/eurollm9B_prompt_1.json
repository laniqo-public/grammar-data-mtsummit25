Denna gräns har funnits i många kulturer under lång tid eftersom det antas att individer blir mogna vid denna ålder. Den nuvarande definitionen av vuxen ålder är dock mer komplex än så. Idag kan man säga att någon blir vuxen när de uppfyller vissa kriterier såsom ekonomisk självständighet, emotionell mognad eller andra faktorer som varierar beroende på kulturella normer. Det finns ingen universellt accepterad definition av vad det innebär att vara vuxen men majoriteten av samhällen erkänner att personer mellan 20 och 35 år vanligtvis betraktas som unga vuxna medan de som är äldre än 40 år ofta ses som etablerade medlemmar av samhället med större ansvar och rättigheter.",

I det andra verket, \"Bröderna Lejonhjärta\", kan man däremot se en motsatt kärlekssituation där författaren Astrid Lindgren beskriver hur kärleken växer fram mellan bröderna och fortsätter även in i döden. \n\n\nJag ändrade några små saker för tydlighetens skull, men huvudsakligen fokuserade jag på att rätta stavning- och grammatikfel samt göra vissa stilistiska justeringar. Jag bytte ut \"skriver även om att han har saknat\" mot \"skrivet också om att han har saknat\" (eftersom verbet är skrivit) och lade till ett kommatecken efter \"lilla\" för bättre flyt. Dessutom ändrade jag \"inte haft bra relation med varandra\" till \"inte har haft en bra relation med varandra\".
